Autoremote-python
=================


Credits: Joao dias (developer of the autoremote plugin for tasker)

Here is a small autoremote python wrapper module. I use it on my raspberry pi.  Copy the module on any linux machine into /usr/lib/python/2.x/ import the module in your python code: Then you can mainly use two functions:

1)autoremote.autoremote_send('YOUR MESSAGE IN QOUTES') 

2)autoremote.autoremote_reg() 

The first one will send any message and the second one will register the device on your other android devices or even eventghost on windows.


There are few variables which I have marked. change the key to your respective autoremote key and localip to your device IP address.﻿
